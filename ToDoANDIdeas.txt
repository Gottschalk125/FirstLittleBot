MAYBE MACHINE LEARNING FOR DECIDING WHICH SHARE WOULD BE NICE
Parallel working and trading different share

Frontend Dashboard: Build a web interface to visualize trades, performance, and bot status. Technologies:

Streamlit (easy for Python, quick setup)

Flask or FastAPI + React or Vue.js (for more flexibility and modern UI)

Dash (Python-based, good for data visualization)

Database Integration: Store trades, configs, and historical data. Technologies:
SQLite (simple, file-based)
PostgreSQL or MySQL (for more features and scalability)
Use SQLAlchemy for ORM in Python

Historical Analysis: Show charts of performance, drawdowns, win/loss ratio, etc. Use matplotlib, plotly, or integrate with the frontend.

User Authentication: If you want multi-user support, add login and user management.

Notifications: Send alerts via email, Telegram, or push notifications for trades/events.

Backtesting Module: Simulate strategies on historical data before live trading.

API: Expose bot status and trade history via REST API for integration.
These features will make your bot more robust and user-friendly. For the frontend, Streamlit is a good starting point for quick results.

On the function side for your bot, you could add:

Risk Management: Functions to set stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing rules.

Strategy Selection: Allow switching between different trading strategies (e.g., trend following, mean reversion).

Trade Logging: Automatically log every trade with details (timestamp, symbol, qty, price, result).

Performance Metrics: Calculate and display metrics like Sharpe ratio, win rate, average profit/loss.

Error Handling: Robust error and exception handling for API failures or network issues.

Scheduling: Run trades at specific times or intervals.

Paper Trading vs. Live Trading: Toggle between simulation and real trading modes.

Multi-Asset Support: Trade multiple symbols in parallel.

Notifications: Send alerts for trade executions, errors, or threshold events.

Config Reloading: Reload config without restarting the bot.

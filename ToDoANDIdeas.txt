Frontend Dashboard: Build a web interface to visualize trades, performance, and bot status. Technologies:

Historical Analysis: Show charts of performance, drawdowns, win/loss ratio, etc. Use matplotlib, plotly, or integrate with the frontend.

User Authentication: If you want multi-user support, add login and user management.

Backtesting Module: Simulate strategies on historical data before live trading.

Performance Metrics: Calculate and display metrics like Sharpe ratio, win rate, average profit/loss.

Error Handling: Robust error and exception handling for API failures or network issues.

Config Reloading: Reload config without restarting the bot.
